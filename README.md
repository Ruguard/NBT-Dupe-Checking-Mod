 **How it Works:** This scans the items UUID and checks the database for multiple items with the same UUID, this may not be 100% accurate but it works for most items. Most of our users have not had problems with this mod yet. Our database is constantly updating when new items are listed on AH so be patient if it loads slower than usual.  

 **Issues:** This Mod is Currently in Beta Testing, Expect to run into Minor/Major Issues 

 **Is this bannable?** Short answer: This mod follows the general interpretation of Hypixel's rules, does not modify packets in any way, and is most likely not 
bannable, but as with all mods, it is use at your own risk.  

 **Hotkeys:** You may change these in Settings->Controls and navigate down to the "NBT Dupe Checker" section. You can also open the UI by typing /NBT in chat  

 **IMPORTANT:** The Source code for this mod WILL NOT be released due to the chance of Users making third party modifications and advertising this mod as a RAT (Remote Access Trojan)
